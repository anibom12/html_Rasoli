                        The Tiger's Apprentice animation is adapted from a book of the same name by Laurence Yep.
                        The story is about a biracial boy who discovers he is a member of an ancient lineage of magical guardians known as the Keepers.
                        Along the way, he is trained by a talking tiger to better understand and manage his abilities.
                        The ultimate goal of this training is to prepare him to unite the Zodiac warriors (animals representing the Chinese Zodiac)
                        to fight against evil forces and prevent the world from being threatened by them.

                        Good news for fans of Garfield, the charming orange cat.
                        In 2024, a new animation centered around Garfield will be released.
                        This animation is based on the comics by Jim Davis and is produced
                        by Columbia Pictures, with Sony Pictures handling its distribution.

                        been released yet, but we will once again join the adventures of this quirky,
                        lasagna-loving cat and see the world through his eyes for a while.

                        Growing up can feel like a bumpy road, and Riley is no exception,
                        as she gets separated from her Midwestern life when her father 
                        starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is controlled
                        by her emotionsâ€”Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness. These emotions
                        live in the headquarters of Riley's mind as characters in this animation
                        and guide her through daily life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to
                        adjust to a new life, turmoil arises in her mind. Although Joy, Riley's
                        main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, there is conflict
                        among the other emotions as they struggle to cope with a new city, home, and school.
